I will add a new **Features Section** to the homepage to display your key features in a modern grid layout.

### **Plan:**

1.  **Locate Insertion Point**:
    *   I will insert the new section immediately after the **Services** section and before the **About** section in `home.blade.php`.

2.  **Design & Layout**:
    *   **Container**: Use a distinct background (e.g., a dark gradient or solid dark color) to separate it from the Services section.
    *   **Grid System**: Implement a responsive grid (`grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`) to display feature cards.
    *   **Card Style**:
        *   Dark themed cards (`bg-[#1c1c1e]`).
        *   Subtle border and hover effects (`border-white/5`, glow on hover).
        *   Icon display (using the stored icon path).
        *   Title and description with appropriate typography.

3.  **Data Integration**:
    *   Iterate over the `$features` collection (which is already passed to the view).
    *   Display `title`, `description`, and `icon` for each feature.

This will enhance the homepage by clearly showcasing what you offer in a visually appealing grid.
