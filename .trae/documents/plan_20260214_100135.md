I will update the **Service Detail** page layout to match the **Project Detail** page layout.

### **Plan:**

1.  **Back Button**:
    *   Move the "Back Button" from the top-left (`top-6`) to the bottom-left (`bottom-6`) with `z-50`.

2.  **Hero/Header Section**:
    *   Currently, services might not have a large hero image like projects, but they have icons.
    *   I will adjust the header to have consistent spacing and typography.
    *   If the service *does* have a hero image logic (or if I should treat the icon as a hero element), I will style it similarly, but based on the current `service-detail.blade.php`, it uses an icon. I will keep the icon but align the padding/margins to match the project detail's cleaner look.

3.  **Content Section**:
    *   Ensure the padding and container width match (`lg:max-w-sm max-w-md min-h-screen mx-auto`).
    *   Use the same `prose prose-invert` styling for the rich text content.

4.  **Consistency**:
    *   Match the background colors (`bg-[#0b0b0d]`).
    *   Match the shadow effects (`lg:shadow-[...]`).

This will create a unified visual experience across both detail pages.
