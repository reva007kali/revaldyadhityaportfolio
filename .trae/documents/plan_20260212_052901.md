I will implement the requested features by setting up a Laravel application with Livewire 3, Breeze authentication, and a custom Admin/Public structure.

**1. Install & Configure Authentication (Breeze + Livewire)**

* Install `laravel/breeze` to handle authentication and automatically set up Livewire v3.

* Run `php artisan breeze:install livewire` to generate the authentication scaffolding with Livewire support.

* This will provide the base `AppLayout` (which we will use for the Admin Panel) and `GuestLayout`.

**2. Database & Models Setup**

* Create migrations and models for the portfolio content:

  * **`Service`**: Title, description, icon/image.

  * **`Project`** (Works): Title, description, image, link.

  * **`FooterSetting`**: Single-record table for footer text, social links, and copyright info.

* Run database migrations to set up the schema.

**3. Layout Implementation**

* **Admin Layout**: Customize the default `resources/views/layouts/app.blade.php` to include a sidebar navigation for managing Services, Projects, and Settings.

* **Public Layout**: Create a new `resources/views/layouts/public.blade.php` for the portfolio homepage, designed for visitors.

**4. Admin Panel Development (Livewire Components)**

* Create Livewire components for CRUD operations:

  * `Admin\Services\ManageServices`: List, add, and delete services.

  * `Admin\Projects\ManageProjects`: List, add, and delete projects.

  * `Admin\Footer\ManageFooter`: Form to update global footer settings.

* Register routes in `routes/web.php` protected by the `auth` middleware.

**5. Portfolio Homepage Development**

* Create a `Home` Livewire component (or Controller) using the `PublicLayout`.

* Fetch and display data from `Service`, `Project`, and `FooterSetting` models.

* Implement a responsive design using Tailwind CSS (installed via Breeze).

**6. Verification**

* Verify authentication flows (Login/Register).

* Verify Admin Panel creates/updates data correctly.

* Verify Homepage displays the dynamic data.
