I will upgrade the **About Page** to be dynamic, with a hero image upload and a rich text editor for content, managed via the admin panel.

### **Plan:**

1.  **Database Updates**:
    *   Modify the `about_sections` table to add a `content` column (longText) for the rich text editor.
    *   The `image` column already exists and can be used for the hero image.

2.  **Admin Panel Updates (`App\Livewire\Admin\About`)**:
    *   **Logic**: Add `$content` property to the component and update `mount` and `save` methods to handle the new field.
    *   **View**:
        *   Replace the simple `textarea` for description with the **Quill Rich Text Editor** (reusing the logic from Projects/Services).
        *   Ensure the image upload field is clearly labeled as "Hero Image".

3.  **Public About Page Updates (`App\Livewire\Public\About`)**:
    *   **Logic**: Fetch the `AboutSection` data in the `render` method.
    *   **View**:
        *   Display the **Hero Image** at the top (similar to Project/Service details).
        *   Display the **Rich Text Content** using `prose prose-invert` for proper formatting in dark mode.
        *   Ensure the layout matches the site's design language (dark theme, responsive).

This will allow you to fully customize the About page's storytelling directly from the admin dashboard.
