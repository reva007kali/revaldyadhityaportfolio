I will proceed with running `composer install` to install the PHP dependencies for your Laravel project.

**Plan:**

1. **Run** **`composer install`**: This command will read the `composer.lock` file (or `composer.json` if lock file is missing) and install the required PHP packages into the `vendor` directory.
2. **Verify Installation**: After the command completes, I will check if the `vendor` directory has been created and populated.

**Note:**

* I noticed that the `.env` file is currently missing (only `.env.example` exists). Standard `composer install` might not automatically create it unless it's a fresh project creation. If you experience issues after installation, we may need to copy `.env.example` to `.env` and generate an application key. For now, I will strictly follow your request to run `composer install`.
