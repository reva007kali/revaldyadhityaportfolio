I will upgrade the admin panel to support image uploads, video handling, and multiple media items for projects, along with image compression.

**1. Infrastructure & Database Updates**

* **Storage**: Ensure the storage link is created (`php artisan storage:link`) for public file access.

* **Project Media Model**: Create a new model `ProjectMedia` (one-to-many relationship with `Project`) to handle multiple images/videos per project.

  * Fields: `project_id`, `file_path`, `file_type` (image/video), `caption`.

* **Update Existing Models**: Modify `HeroSection`, `AboutSection`, `Service`, `Project` to store file paths instead of URLs.

* **Migrations**: Update database schema to support these changes.

**2. Backend Logic (Image Upload & Compression)**

* **Package Installation**: Install `intervention/image` for image compression/resizing.

* **Trait/Service**: Create a reusable `HandlesFileUploads` trait or service to:

  * Validate files.

  * Compress images (using Intervention Image).

  * Store files in the `public` disk.

  * Return the stored path.

* **Livewire Components Update**: Refactor `Admin\Hero`, `Admin\About`, `Admin\Services`, and `Admin\Projects` to use `WithFileUploads` and the new upload logic.

**3. Admin UI Updates**

* **File Input**: Replace text inputs with `<input type="file">` in all admin forms.

* **Preview**: Add image/video preview for uploaded files.

* **Project Manager**:

  * Update `Admin\Projects\Index` to handle multiple file uploads.

  * Add a UI to manage (add/remove/caption) the gallery of media for each project.

**4. Frontend Updates**

* **Display Logic**: Update `livewire/public/home.blade.php` to display uploaded images correctly (using `asset()`).

* **Project Gallery**: Implement a carousel or grid layout for projects with multiple media items.

**5. Verification**

* Verify uploading images works for Hero, About, and Services.

* Verify uploading multiple images/videos for Projects.

* Verify image compression reduces file size.

* Verify frontend displays the new media correctly.
