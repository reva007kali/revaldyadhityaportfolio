I will transform the public layout to simulate an **iPhone mockup** experience when viewed on large screens, while maintaining a standard mobile experience on smaller devices.

### **Plan:**

1.  **Layout Wrapper (`layouts.public.blade.php`)**:
    *   **Large Screens (`lg:`)**:
        *   Create a centered container with a dark background to serve as the "desktop" backdrop.
        *   Implement the **iPhone Mockup Frame**:
            *   Rounded corners (`rounded-[3rem]`).
            *   Thick borders (`border-8 border-gray-900` or similar).
            *   Shadows (`shadow-2xl`) to create depth.
            *   Fixed width/height aspect ratio typical of mobile devices (e.g., `max-w-[400px]`).
            *   Hidden scrollbar for the internal content area.
    *   **Small Screens**:
        *   Content takes up the full width/height (standard mobile view).

2.  **Navigation & Content**:
    *   Ensure the `fixed` positioning of the navbar relates to the *mockup container* on desktop, not the window. (This might require changing `fixed` to `absolute` inside the relative container for the desktop view).
    *   Ensure the "Home", "Works", etc. sections scroll *inside* the mockup frame.

This creates a unique "app-like" presentation for your portfolio on desktop browsers.
