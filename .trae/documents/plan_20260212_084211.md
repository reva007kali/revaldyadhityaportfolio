I will implement a dedicated "Works" page with an Instagram-style grid layout and update the homepage to link to it.

**1. Update Homepage (`home.blade.php`)**

* Add a "View All Works" button at the bottom of the `#projects` section.

* Style it with the existing Swiss Design aesthetic (bold, uppercase, high contrast).

**2. Create "Works" Page (Livewire Component)**

* Generate a new Livewire component: `App\Livewire\Public\Works`.

* Register the route `/works` in `routes/web.php`.

**3. Implement Instagram-Style Grid Layout**

* **Grid**: Create a responsive 3-column grid (`grid-cols-3`) with square aspect ratios.

* **Content**: Loop through all projects/media.

* **Hover Effect**: Show a subtle overlay with likes/comments icon style (or just the project title) on hover.

**4. Detail Modal (Lightbox)**

* Use **Alpine.js** to create a modal that opens when a grid item is clicked.

* **Left Side**: Full-size image or video.

* **Right Side**: Project title, description, and captions (mimicking the Instagram post view).

* **Navigation**: Add "Next" and "Previous" buttons within the modal.

**Todo List:**

1. Modify `home.blade.php` to add the "View All Works" button.
2. Create the `Works` Livewire component and view.
3. Define the `/works` route.
4. Implement the grid layout and modal logic in `works.blade.php`.
