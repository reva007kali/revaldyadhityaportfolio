I will completely overhaul the application to match the requested design and functionality, including a redesigned Admin Panel with a responsive sidebar and a fully customizable Portfolio Homepage.

**1. Database & Models Expansion**

* Create new models and migrations to store editable content for all sections:

  * **`HeroSection`**: Title, subtitle, background image, CTA text, CTA link.

  * **`AboutSection`**: Title, description, image, button text, button link.

  * **`Feature`**: Title, description, icon (for the "Benefits" section).

  * **`PricingPlan`**: Name, price, description, features list (JSON), CTA button.

  * **`ContactMessage`**: To store form submissions (Name, Email, Message).

* *Note:* *`Services`,* *`Projects`, and* *`FooterSetting`* *already exist.*

**2. Admin Panel Redesign (Responsive Sidebar)**

* **Layout**: Replace the default top navigation with a modern **Sidebar Layout** (`layouts/admin.blade.php`).

  * **Desktop**: Fixed sidebar on the left.

  * **Mobile/Tablet**: Collapsible hamburger menu with a slide-out drawer.

* **Dashboard**: Update the dashboard to show quick stats (e.g., total messages, active projects).

* **Management Pages**: Create Livewire components for managing the new sections:

  * `Admin\Hero`: Form to edit hero content.

  * `Admin\About`: Form to edit about section content.

  * `Admin\Features`: CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for features.

  * `Admin\Pricing`: CRUD for pricing plans.

  * `Admin\Messages`: Read-only view for contact form submissions.

**3. Public Frontend Implementation (The "Design")**

* **Layout**: Update `layouts/public.blade.php` to match the "dark/elegant" aesthetic (Dark header, rounded sections).

* **Home Component**: Completely rewrite `resources/views/livewire/public/home.blade.php` to implement the requested sections in order:

  1. **Hero**: Dynamic background/text.
  2. **About**: Short description with "About" button.
  3. **Services**: Existing list, styled as cards.
  4. **Projects**: Existing list, styled as a grid.
  5. **Features**: New "Why Choose Me" section.
  6. **Pricing**: New Pricing tables.
  7. **Contact**: Working contact form (saves to DB).
  8. **Footer**: Dynamic footer.

**4. Asset Management**

* Ensure Tailwind CSS is configured to handle the new styling requirements (rounded corners, specific colors).

**5. Verification**

* Verify the Admin Panel is responsive on mobile and desktop.

* Verify all sections are editable in Admin.

* Verify the Contact Form saves messages.

* Verify the Frontend matches the requested design structure.
