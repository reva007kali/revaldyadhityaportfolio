I will implement dynamic detail pages for Projects and Services with a fully functional Rich Text Editor (Quill) in the admin panel.

### **Plan:**

1.  **Database Updates**:
    *   Create a migration to add `slug` and `content` columns to both `projects` and `services` tables.
    *   The `content` column will store the rich text (HTML).
    *   The `slug` column will be used for SEO-friendly URLs (e.g., `/works/my-awesome-project`).

2.  **Backend Logic (Models)**:
    *   Update `Project` and `Service` models to automatically generate a `slug` from the `title` when created or updated.

3.  **Admin Panel Enhancements**:
    *   **Rich Text Editor Integration**: I will integrate **Quill Editor** (a powerful, modern rich text editor) into the Admin Panel. This will allow you to:
        *   Format text (Bold, Italic, Headings, etc.).
        *   Add Lists (Bulleted, Numbered).
        *   Insert Links, Images, and Videos.
    *   Update the **Projects** and **Services** management forms to include this new editor for the "Content" field.

4.  **Frontend Implementation**:
    *   **Detail Pages**: Create two new dynamic pages:
        *   `Project Detail` (accessible via `/works/{slug}`)
        *   `Service Detail` (accessible via `/services/{slug}`)
    *   **Design**: These pages will be styled with a modern layout (similar to the About page) to display the rich content beautifully.
    *   **Navigation**: Update the "Read More" or card links on the Home and Works pages to point to these new detail pages.

5.  **Routes**:
    *   Register the new public routes for accessing these detail pages.

This approach ensures you have full control over the content of your project and service pages directly from the admin panel.
