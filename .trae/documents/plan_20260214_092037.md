I will redesign the Admin Panel to be **Mobile-First**, **Fully Responsive**, and feature a **Dark Mode SaaS Theme**.

### **Plan:**

1.  **Layout Redesign (`layouts.app.blade.php`)**:
    *   **Mobile-First Structure**: Ensure the sidebar is hidden by default on mobile and toggles smoothly with an overlay.
    *   **Dark Mode Theme**:
        *   Change background colors to deep dark shades (e.g., `#0b0b0d`, `#1c1c1e`).
        *   Update text colors to white/gray for readability.
        *   Style the sidebar and header to match the dark aesthetic.
    *   **Responsive Header**: Adjust padding and layout for smaller screens.

2.  **Global Styles (`app.css`)**:
    *   Define new utility classes or Tailwind config for the dark SaaS theme if needed (though inline classes will be primary).
    *   Ensure inputs, tables, and cards have a consistent dark mode look.

3.  **Component Updates**:
    *   **Navigation Links**: Update hover states and active states to use modern, glowing accents suitable for dark mode.
    *   **Tables & Forms**: Ensure all admin forms (Projects, Services, etc.) and tables stack properly on mobile and look good in dark mode.
    *   **Quill Editor**: Style the editor to fit the dark theme (already handled in previous steps, but will double-check).

4.  **Implementation Details**:
    *   Background: `#0b0b0d` (Deep Black/Gray)
    *   Cards/Sidebar: `#1c1c1e` (Slightly lighter dark)
    *   Borders: `border-white/5` or `border-white/10`
    *   Accents: Keep the "Swiss Blue" or switch to a more vibrant neon blue/purple for the SaaS vibe.

This transformation will make the admin panel look like a modern, high-end SaaS application that works perfectly on your phone.
